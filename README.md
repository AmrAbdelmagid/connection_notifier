#### ConnectionNotifierToggler

If you want to toggle between some widgets automatically based on connection state.

```dart
ConnectionNotifierToggler(
        onConnectionStatusChanged: (connected) {
          /// that means it is still in the initialization phase.
          if (connected == null) return;
          print(connected);
        },
        connected: Center(
          key: UniqueKey(),
          child: const Text(
            'Connected',
            style: TextStyle(
              color: Colors.green,

            ),
          ),
        ),
        disconnected: Center(
          key: UniqueKey(),
          child: const Text(
            'Disconnected',
            style: TextStyle(
              color: Colors.red,

#### ConnectionNotifierTools

Tools that make it very easy to check on the internet connection status ANY WHERE inside your project.

At first you need to initialize it before using it's data. To do that, simply call this:

```dart
  await ConnectionNotifierTools.initialize();
```
Then you can use these tools as you want:

```dart
 /// A boolean that has the latest update about the connection status
 ConnectionNotifierTools.isConnected;

 /// A broadcast stream that emits on every change in the connection status. 
 ConnectionNotifierTools.onStatusChange;
```

And that's it!
